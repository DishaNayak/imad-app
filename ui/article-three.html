                    Welcome to my third article, The “general skills” are a mixed bag. They do not fall into any specific category of skills to learn. </p>
                <p>
                   These are the type of skills we often think of when we want to learn something new,
                </p>
                <p>
                     but never invest the time and effort involved to actually learn them.
New skill to learn can be useful, fun and are often great at making a “well-rounded” person.
